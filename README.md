Hello!

Here is my try at battleship using HTML/CSS/JS.
I am having a lot of fun building it although it is a lot more complex of a game then I initially realized.
Determining how I was going to build out CPU logic was my first battle of many.
I ended up just using mathfloor to pick a random index on the board to create a random point for the cpu to "attack", and depending on wether or not it hit or missed it would return cpu hit or miss.
another complication im running into is how im supposed to define the shapes of the ships, I really feel as if im doing extra work defining the ships sizes with the array. This is a portion of the code I will reavaluate in the future.
The game still needs a lot of work before it is a well oiled machine. Like the bug with the start game button. It will keep spawning more and more shipps until it crashes. This will be another thing to fix in the coming future.
My favorite part of the code so far is the generate random ship indx function. I thought it was cool to be able to have the ships placed randomly, although I know that battleship you are supposed to be able to place your ships yourself, and yes this will be a feature I plan on adding but, it kind of made a little unique in my own efforts cause this adds a little more skill to finiding out where the ships are place.
I will also add multiplayer to this so that two people on the same machine or diffferent machines can play. Im still polishing this and those are features that will come later in the process.

Hope you enjoy what I have so far it has been a good time building this project.
